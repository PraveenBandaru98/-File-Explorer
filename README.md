I am displaying 10 files at a time.
When we go to command mode , my code goes to the directory where the code file is, we can using "goto" by using relative or absolute paths.
My code runs better in full terminal as made some assumptions to move cursor.
when 'h' key is pressed we move to root/home folder.
when 'q' key is pressed we quit from the program.
when ':' key is pressed  we move to command mode.
I used "." for current working directory.
I used "~" for home.
I used "/" for going to any folder from cwd.
